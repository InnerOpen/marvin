# Marvin Agents v1 (2026-09-13)

Design: brain vault `20-Projects/Marvin Agents.md`. v1 scope (Jared, 2026-09-13): agents as first-class
workspace objects, kinds `persona` + `model`, seeded system agents, bubble picker, MCP projection.
First user agent: `workshop` (read-only, brand voice) for `mash-burn-co`. Threads/memory = v2, workflow kind = v3.

## Plan
- [x] Model `WorkspaceAgentModel` (`workspace_agents`): group_id, slug, name, description, kind, system_prompt,
      model_override, tool_allowlist (JSON list), default_register, min_role, sources (JSON), enabled, created_by.
      Unique (group_id, slug). Alembic migration via `task py:migrate`.
- [x] Schemas `AgentCreate/Update/Read` (camelCase wire), kind Literal["persona","model"].
- [x] Repo registered in `get_repositories` (mirror webhooks/api_clients).
- [x] Routes `/api/ai/agents`: list (merges **virtual system agents** `marvin`, `ask`, `chat` — no rows, no seeding),
      get, create/patch/delete (role-gated), `POST /agents/{slug}/run` (AIAgentRequest body).
- [x] Execution: refactor `run_agent` so the loop tail is shared; persona = system prompt + register + context,
      tools = `_build_agent_tools` ∩ allowlist; model kind = plain completion. Execution row `agent:<slug>`.
- [x] MCP projection: registry tools `list_agents` + `run_agent(agent, message, history?)` (source mcp) so
      MarvinMCP/n8n can converse with any agent with zero MCP changes.
- [x] Frontend bubble: `/agents` (list) + `/use <slug>` (switch; persisted in localStorage) → runAgent posts to
      `/agents/{slug}/run`; default stays `marvin`.
- [x] Backup export/import carries `workspace_agents`.
- [x] Tests: schema validation, system agents listing, allowlist filtering, role gates, run via ScriptedProvider.
- [x] pytest (full suite) + Biome/astro green; committed `75d4410f`; pushed; CI green; rolled out 2026-09-13 22:10 UTC (migration applied, routes verified).
- [ ] Seed `workshop` on mash-burn-co after rollout (script for Jared to run as admin).

- [x] Added after the n8n settings review: per-agent `allow_writes` (default off) on top of the allowlist; caller still needs AUTHOR+.

## RAG vocabulary + workspace overview (2026-09-13, after the image fix)
Jared asked Chat and workshop "summary of what's in the RAG": Chat guessed Red/Amber/Green; workshop keyword-searched "RAG".
- [x] `workspace_preamble(name, tool_names)` — injected first in `_run_agent_core` for every persona run: which workspace,
      what the content is, that "the RAG / knowledge base / index" means it, and which bound tool answers which question.
- [x] `workspace_overview` read-only tool (library_read): entries by type+status, collections, assets, resources, tags, index coverage.
      `ask` may use it (allowlist + prompt updated).
- [x] `model_agent_system_prompt()` shared by the agent `model` kind and `/chat`: names the RAG synonyms, says it can't see them,
      points to Ask/Marvin instead of guessing.
- [x] Tests: registration/category, preamble content + tool gating, ask allowlist, model prompt, DB-backed overview counts.
- [x] Full suite green; `7ab55c2d` pushed; backend rolled out 2026-09-13; overview verified in the pod (62 entries / 18 collections / 53 assets, index coverage per type). Jared to re-ask the RAG question.

## Act-don't-announce + MCP routing + Ask link (2026-09-13, later)
- [x] Loop nudge for deferrals (once); tests for nudge/once/no-tools/regex.
- [x] Preamble: act-don't-announce + connected MCP servers list.
- [x] Sidebar Ask quick link (top group), Settings active-state excludes it.
- [x] `699540fd` built; backend + frontend rolled out 2026-09-13. Jared re-asked: worked (2026-09-13).
- [x] MCP hints (`8929438c`): client keeps readOnlyHint/destructiveHint; rows mcp_read / mcp / mcp_destructive; discovered tools in catalog + permissions; server test returns hints. Rolled out 2026-09-13; verified in the pod.
- [x] cloudflare-mcp: token (iwobble account) lacked user:read/account:read scope; Jared fixed the scopes 2026-09-13 — tools/list now returns docs, search, execute.

## Review
- Shipped v1 as designed plus `allow_writes` (from the n8n settings review). Caller-role bound: an agent never exceeds the user.
- Kept `/api/ai/agent` byte-for-byte in behaviour by extracting its tail into `_run_agent_core`; named agents reuse it.
- Deliberate v1 limits: `run_agent` (MCP) binds registry tools only (no AI ops / external MCP); no threads, so no "ask first".
- Gotchas: perl `s|…|…|` with `|`/`@` inside replacements mangled three edits (use Python for multi-line code edits);
  Pydantic v2 validators can't be shared by attribute assignment (define per class); bare `python -c` imports hit the
  dev Postgres driver — verify via pytest; the venv lacks psycopg2 so migrations are hand-written here.
- Next: allow/block permission matrix with tool categories; seed `workshop` (admin script ready).

# Marvin Agents v1.5 — permission matrix + admin pages (2026-09-13, "ok" from Jared)

Three pieces: (1) backend policy model + matrix, (2) `ai-agents` management page, (3) `ai-ask` becomes the
agent chat page. Ask-first stays v2 (threads).

## Plan
- [x] Tool categories: `services/ai/tools/categories.py` (id, label, writes) + name→category map; `ToolSpec.category`
      resolved via helper (no edits to the builtins). AI ops → `ai_ops`, external MCP → `mcp`.
- [x] Agent `tool_policy` JSON (`{category|tool: allow|block}`) — model column + migration, schema, exporter/loader.
- [ ] Service: `resolve_policy(spec, name, category, read_only, role)` → allow|block + reason; `_restrict_tools` uses it
      (allowlist ∩ policy; write categories default to `allow_writes`; role still caps).
- [x] API: `GET /api/ai/agents/catalog` (categories + tools + ops), `GET /api/ai/agents/{slug}/permissions` (effective
      matrix for the caller). Tests.
- [x] Frontend `workspace/settings/ai-agents.astro`: list, create/edit (all fields), matrix (group default + per-action
      Allow/Block), delete; built-ins read-only. Nav entry.
- [x] Frontend `ai-ask.astro` rework: agent picker (default `ask`), transcript + history, register toggle, citations
      for `ask` (operation path), tools-used for others, reindex kept, "manage agents" link. Nav label → "Ask".
- [x] Bubble: `/agents` shows read-only/rw (allowWrites); effective matrix lives in Ask's Tools panel.
- [x] Image attachments: Ask keeps the attachment for the whole conversation (chip shown once); new read-only
      `view_image` tool (library_read) describes from pixels via the vision model, persisting only the execution row —
      read-only agents (workshop) can now answer "what is this?" without `describe-image`'s write-back.
- [x] Biome/astro check + full pytest green; `de56ba94` pushed; CI green; backend + frontend rolled out 2026-09-13 22:45 UTC; migration + routes + pages verified.

## Review
- Matrix is data-driven (categories.py + registry flags); the caller-role cap is enforced in resolve_policy, not the UI.
- Kept `ask` on the operation path in the chat page so citations stay exact; other agents use the run endpoint.
- Gotchas: SDK `assets.upload` requires `{slug, name}`; Astro scoped styles need `:global()` for innerHTML-rendered matrix rows; roll out BOTH deployments.
- Deferred: ask-first (needs threads), provider breadth adapter, extra operations (moderation, image/audio/video).

# Marvin Agents v2 — threads, live steps, ask-first (2026-09-14, plan approved)

Substrate first (server-side thread), then the two features that need it. Threads own-only (admins see all); Ask page only;
no token streaming (providers are sync). Each slice committed + rolled out on its own.

## Slice A — threads
- [ ] Models `ai_threads` / `ai_thread_messages` (+ status/pending_json now, for C) + migration `f7b3c4d5e6a8`.
- [ ] Service `services/ai/threads.py`: get_or_create, history_rows, append_turn (truncated results; names only when log_outputs off), extract_sources, touch.
- [ ] Controller: `AIAgentRequest.thread_id`; runs resolve/create the thread, persist both turns, return `threadId` + `sources`; `GET/GET one/PATCH/DELETE /threads`.
- [ ] Frontend: Ask page uses `threadId` (drawer: list/reopen/rename/delete); `ask` routed through `/agents/ask/run`, citations from the `search_content` step.
- [ ] Tests `tests/test_ai_threads.py` (db_session); ruff + full suite; Biome + astro check; commit, push, rollout, verify in pod.

## Slice B — live steps
- [ ] `run_agent_loop(on_event=)`; `services/ai/run_progress.py` (process-local, like model_pull._JOBS); `client_run_id` + `GET /agents/runs/{id}/progress`.
- [ ] Ask page: placeholder bubble with a polled step timeline.

## Slice C — ask first
- [ ] `PolicyValue` gains `ask`; `resolve_policy` + role cap; `AgentTool.requires_approval`; loop pends ask calls, `ResumeState`; serialize/deserialize messages.
- [ ] `_finish_agent_run` tail; awaiting_approval on thread/execution; `POST /threads/{id}/resume`; events approval_requested/granted/rejected.
- [ ] Frontend: matrix "Ask first"; approval card in Ask.
